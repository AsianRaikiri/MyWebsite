                My personal story:
            </h2>
            <p>
                I am 21 years old, I have just started studying Computer Science at the University of Applied Science in Karlsruhe.
                After a few years of not really knowing what I wanted to do with my life, I started to try to get an Idea of
                what my future should look like. After a lot of thinking and changing between interests, I finally noticed how much
                joy I had at creating something I can call my own. But since I suck at creative writing or arts in general, I settled
                for programming. Another helpful bonus was, that this way I learn a lot more about how the most important part of my life,
                the Internet, actually works.
